 @discussion Thoughts have an array of Photo objects and therefore a a relational-hierarchy. We want to save all Photos related to a Thought and so we flatten each Thought so that each Photo object is represented in the array to save. Input, just Thought objects. Output, those original Thoughts and thier related Photos alongside them
 @param arrayOfThoughts is an array of soley Thought objects with their related photos
 @return an array of objects to save to CloudKit that were originally trapped in the hierarchy of a Thought
