 @discussion parentCollection will still be nil after this method executes. All other properties will have to be initalized by the utilizer of this Thought
 @param context The NSManagedObjectContext to add this Thought object to
 @param collection The parent Collection of this Thought object. Nullable so that parentCollection could be set at a later time
