/*!
 @abstract based on a placement property, relative order is assigned to an object
 @discussion implementing this class requires a placement property and the order of that placement property can be set at anytime. In the Orderer class, pass an array of id<Orderable> objects to the method orderObjectsBasedOnPlacementInArray: and each object's placement value will be set according to their relative order in the passed Array (let's hope this works with Pass-by-Value so that in the end the objects have their placements set correctly)
